# CLustering-Model

Problem Statement:
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes. After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid.

Approach:
Categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.Suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.

Model Objective:
Cluster the countries by the factors mentioned and recommend to the CEO.

The tasks performed in the model presented below are:
1. Necessary data inspection and EDA tasks suitable for this dataset.
2. Outlier Analysis
3. Tried both K-means and Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters.
4. Analysed the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid by comparing how these three variables - [gdpp, child_mort and income] vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.
5. Performed visualisations on the clusters that have been formed.
6. Finally ,listed the 5 countries which are in direst need of aid based on the analysis done.
