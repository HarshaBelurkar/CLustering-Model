It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes. After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid. \n\n## Approach:\nCategorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.Suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.\n\n## Model Objective:\n- Cluster the countries by the factors mentioned and recommend to the CEO.\n\n## The tasks performed in the model presented below are:\n- Necessary data inspection and EDA tasks suitable for this dataset.\n- Outlier Analysis\n- Tried both K-means and Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters.\n- Analysed the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid by comparing how these three variables - [gdpp, child_mort and income] vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.\n- Performed visualisations on the clusters that have been formed.  \n- Finally ,listed the 5 countries which are in direst need of aid based on the analysis done.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Steps followed to build this model\n1.

When the financial help is provided to the countries based on the low GDP indicator, such countries should be able to produce more goods and services, which in turn helps in the countries overall development.\n2. Low Income is a sign of the inability to purchase commodities or services which can keep a family comfortable or in dire need of resources in case of very low income families. As such, foreign help would provide the required help to such families at a lower cost.\n3. Child mortality rate can be the third indicator as it is not directly linked to the resources available, as it is affected to other reasons like incomplete care of the mother during pregnancy, irresponsibility of the health care workers, etc. Thus, child moratlity rate can be considered as the third factor in this problem, keeping in mind the malnutrition and other financial problems the country is facing.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hierarchical Clustering","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"country_df_hierarchy = country_df.copy()\ncountry_df_hierarchy=country_df_hierarchy.drop(['cluster_id'],axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"country_df_hierarchy.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# single linkage -

Gross Domestic Product of a country indicates the total value of production of goods and services of that country and thus indicates that the above five countries have the least production happening in their country. This in turn would lead to the need of requiring external support from other countries. When the financial help is provided to the countries based on the low GDP indicator, such countries should be able to produce more goods and services, which in turn helps in the countries overall development.\n2. Low Income is a sign of the inability to purchase commodities or services which can keep a family comfortable or in dire need of resources in case of very low income families. As such, foreign help would provide the required help to such families at a lower cost.\n3. Child mortality rate can be the third indicator as it is not directly linked to the resources available, as it is affected to other reasons like incomplete care of the mother during pregnancy, irresponsibility of the health care workers, etc. Thus, child moratlity rate can be considered as the third factor in this problem, keeping in mind the malnutrition and other financial problems the country is facing.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
